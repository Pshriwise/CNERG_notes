Things I've learned while trying to build make_watertight (et. al.) and
tie itaps into my python distribution.

1) Don't be afraid to ask Andy questions. He's extremely helpful and a nice guy
2) Don't doubt yourself too much, but you still don't know jack
3) Environment paths are huge for all of this

the check_watertight algorithm (and I'm assuming the make_watertight algorithm)
both rely on what version of cubit you are using. This needs to be kept track 
of thoroughly while doing the testing. 

Remembered another question: Will make_watertight also break an already good 
geometry?

If make xxxxx isn't working because there are other make files it isn't 
finding, try just running make first. (You idiot)

Try to keep away from building in your own directory. The CNERG files are 
already configured appropriately. (Though separate cubit builds will be necesarry 
it seems)

That's all for now.
