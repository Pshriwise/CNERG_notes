On building triangle with meshkit:

In order to build the triangle libraries in such a way that meshkit will find them

1) add the line:

trilibrary: $(BIN)triangle.o
+    ar r libtriangle.a triangle.o 

   to the make file and run make trilibrary

2) move the triangle.h file into an include dir inside the top trianlge directory
3) move the libtriangle.a file into a lib dir inside the top triangle directory

NOTE: if you have build meshkit with the --enable-shared flag, your libraries are dynamic and the 
      triangle libraries must be build as such. This requires you to add an additional flag to the 
      make file in the CSWITCHES varialbe "-fPIC" which will allow you to link properly.
