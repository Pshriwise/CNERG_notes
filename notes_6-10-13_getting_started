Information taken from a meeting with Elliott Biondo on 6/10/13:

dagmc allows you to import a separate geometry file into an mcnp run by adding gcad=<geometryfile> to the mcnp
command line.

these geometry files can be created by maually taking a file and importing it into CUBIT (.sat) or creating a
full geometry within CUBIT. DAGMC will then preprocess the geometry into an .h5m file and run mcnp unless it is
directed to only build the geometry file into the .h5m format using the command dagmc_preproc.

inorder to create a .sat file from a manually written mcnp geometry, the mcnp2cad program can be used. 

**NOTE:most of these programs are already buildin the /filespace/groups/cnerg/opt/ directory

additional takeaways on CUBIT:

CUBIT keeps a history of all command line-version things that you do within the program. these can be found in
the same directory as the geometry file and can be used to redo commands or rebuild geometries if necessary.

-BEFORE trying to use a CUBIT-created geometry, the commands "imprint body all" and "merge body all" must be run
and resolved in the CUBIT terminal before the mcnp geometry will be considered valid by dagmc or mcnp. This involves verifying that the
correct surfaces agree with one another and that the proper volumes have been removed or maintained properly.

That's all for now...
